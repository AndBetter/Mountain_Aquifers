# Mountain_Aquifers

This repository contains the python code to simulate unconfined groundwater flows in complex topographies under a wide range of 
geomorphoclimatic conditions. The simulations explore the role of subsurface water flows in the overall hydrological functioning 
of mountain catchments, specifically on:

- groundwater storage
- travel times and flowapath lengths
- upwelling and groundwater recharge fluxes
- the partitioning of incoming recharge into quick runoff and slow groundwater flows
- the extension of the grondwater-fed portion of the drainage network.

As the code requires basic geographical information as input (e.g. a DEM), and has a flexible parametrization, it can easily be extended to different morphological settings.
